//! La Coctelera configuration module.
//!
//! # Description
//!
//! This module includes all the definitions for the app's settings and the
//! objects that automate reading the configuration from files or environment
//! variables and parsing them to Rust's native types.
//!
//! Some settings must be overridden by environment variables.
//! All the environment variables that are meant to be used within this module
//! shall use the prefix `LACOCTELERA`.
//!
//! # Settings
//!
//! The settings of the application may be set via 2 methods:
//! - Using the configuration files located in the `config` folder.
//! - Using environment variables.
//!
//! The former is advised for settings that usually take the same values and don't include
//! any value that shall not be exposed to the public (passwords, tokens, ...).
//! The latter is advised for settings that we only intend to set for a limited amount of
//! time, i.e. a debug session, or contain private values.
//!
//! ## Environment Variables
//!
//! The following environment variables are accepted by the application:
//!
//! - `RUN_MODE`: `devel`, `prod`. This variable shall take a value that refers to a
//!    configuration file in the `config` folder. The settings found there will
//!    overridden the settings found in `base.toml`. When not set, `prod` is considered
//!    as run mode.
//!
//! Variables defined within configuration files can be overridden using `LACOCTELERA`
//! prefix. Variables need to be scoped in the same way as they are found in the configuration
//! files. For example, to override [LogSettings::tracing_level]:
//!
//! ```bash
//! $ LACOCTELERA__APPLICATION__TRACING_LEVEL=trace ./lacoctelera
//! ```
//!
//! **Note that the scope separator is a double `_`.**
//!
//! When multiple configuration variables are needed to be overridden, it is advised to
//! create a `local.toml` file within the `config` folder.
//!
//! ## Configuration Files
//!
//! All the required configuration variables are found in: `base.toml`, `prod.toml`
//! and `devel.toml`. The former refers to common settings that are usually applied
//! to both running scenarios: production and development. Any variable found there can
//! be overridden if defined on any of the latter files.
//!
//! The descriptions for each variable are found in the `Struct`s docs:
//! - [ApplicationSettings] for settings that apply to the main application.
//! - [DataBaseSettings] for settings that apply to the DB connection.
