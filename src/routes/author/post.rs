/// POST method for the /author endpoint (Restricted)
///
/// # Description
///
/// This method creates a new author entry in the DB, which is described by the `Author` schema. When a new author
/// is aimed to be registered in the DB, only providing a valid email address is mandatory. A confirmation email will
/// be sent to that email, so unvalidated authors won't be able to register content in the DB. This is a measure to
/// avoid spamming content in the DB.
///
/// When an author registers without providing a name, a *funny name* will be assigned by the backend logic.
///
/// Authors are identified by an unique ID, thus there's no issue when the same names are registered multiple times.
